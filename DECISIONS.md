## 2026-09-14 — Connectivity roadmap completion + operational readiness fixes

Full detail: `knowledge/operator/architecture-decisions/2026-09-14-connectivity-roadmap-and-operational-readiness.md`

- Agents 04/10 now receive per-workspace GitHub credentials via
  `build_agent_credentials()` (were silently falling back to a shared
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var — a cross-tenant leak risk for every Growth+
  customer). Agents 04/08/10 route PR creation through
  `core/repo_tools.py` instead of three duplicate GitHub API
  implementations.
- Real per-workspace Kubernetes credentials (migration 025) and Azure
  DevOps PAT + webhook secret (migration 024) replace prior global
  stopgaps.
- `workspaces.contact_email` added (migration 026) — the table had no
  email column at all, so nothing in Cloud Decoded's own code could ever
  send a welcome email or an Enterprise MCP-invite alert. Now required
  and validated at signup.
- GitHub App "the-cloud-decoded" is registered but still marked private
  in GitHub's own settings — a private App can only be installed by its
  owning account, so no real customer can install it until it's flipped
  to public (GitHub-side setting, not a code change).
- Deploy note: Railway's and Vercel's GitHub auto-deploy webhooks did
  not pick up this session's push within a reasonable wait; both were
  triggered manually (`railway service source connect` re-trigger,
  `vercel --prod`) from the same pushed commits. Worth checking whether
  the GitHub webhook itself is still correctly configured on both sides.
